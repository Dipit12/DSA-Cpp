// Stack is an abstract data type - specific order in which you can insert/delete your elements
// In array/linked list, you can access, insert and delete elements anywhere, unlike in Stacks

// Order - LIFO - last in first out
// In a stack entry and exit points both are same

// To insert an element in a stack - use push(element)
/*
eg: push(10)
    push(20)
    push(30)
    pop() - to delete an element
    top() - to access the topmost element

    10,20,30
    10,20
    10
    would print - 10

    size() - returns the size
    isEmpty - returns boolean values

   Recursion uses Stack
