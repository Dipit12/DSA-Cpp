// Pointers in C++
when we say that
int num = 5;
a block is created in the memory called num, whose value is 5
cout << num;
every variable is mapped to an address
when we say cout << num, then at the backend, the address is found out of the varibale and its value is displayed to the screen

Pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable
Never ever declare an empty pointer ie int *ptr;
this is a bad programming practise since we dont know where this pointer is pointing
Datatype of variable and pointer should be same
eg: int num =5; -> int *ptr = &num;
    char ch = 'A' -> char *ptr = &ch;

In *ptr, * is the dereferencing operator
num and *ptr point towards the same value

When we dont know where to point the pointer, we point it to 0
