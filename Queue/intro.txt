// Just like stacks, queue is a data structure
It's an abstract data type, meaning there is a specific order in which you can insert/delete your elements
Follows the principle of FIFO - first in first out
In stack, entry and exit points both are same but in a queue entry and exit points are different

Operations we can perform in a queue:
1. Inserting an element - push()
2. Deleting an element - pop()
3. Access element - can only access the front element - front()
4. size() - returns size of the queue
5. isEmpty - return bool value 

A queue can be implemented using 2 ways:
1. Arrays
2. LinkedList

After implementing the queue using arrays, there would be a size constraint to remove that we would use Dynamic queue
